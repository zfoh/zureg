Hello {{info.name}},

This is a reminder that you are currently registered for ZuriHac, but
you have not yet confirmed your registration.

In order to get a good idea of how many people are attending, we are
asking EVERYONE to either CONFIRM their registration, or CANCEL in
case you cannot make it.  You can do both at the following link:

    https://zureg.zfoh.ch/ticket?uuid={{uuid}}

Confirming your registration will give you access to your ticket, and
canceling will free up space for the people on the waiting list --
thank you in advance!

Warm regards,
The ZuriHac Registration Bot
