Hello {{info.name}},

ZuriHac is happening in 10 days, and we couldn't be more excited to
see each other in person again after 2 years of virtual events!  There
is a lot of info in this email, but please stick with us and read
through it to make the most out of the event :-)

Here is some practical information:

 -  Important: Please confirm (or cancel) here:

    https://zureg.zfoh.ch/ticket?uuid={{uuid}}

    This helps us know how many people are attending, which we need
    to plan ahead for things like food and rooms. Confirming your
    registration will give you access to your ticket, that you can
    show at the registration desk.

 -  You can find the schedule and many details at https://zurihac.com.
    We will keep on updating this throughout the week and the website
    remains the "single source of truth".

 -  Simon Peyton Jones, Gabriele Keller, Andrew Lelechenko (bodigrim)
    and Alejandro Serrano will be giving talks!

 -  Bring an adaptor for swiss electrical sockets.  A lot of european
    plugs might not fit:
    https://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets/j/

 -  You can join our Discord with this invite link:
    https://discord.gg/3XnhFKfTFz. We will use it to communicate
    important information and announcements during the event, but it's
    also extremely useful to socialize with fellow participants

 -  It's a long-standing tradition to have a drink next to the lake
    the day before the hackathon with Haskellers who are already in
    town.  We'll have two: one in Zurich and one in Rapperswil.
    Join #friday-zurich and #friday-rapperswil on Discord for details.

 -  We've posted a list of projects that people are planning on
    working on here: https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2022/projects.html -- feel
    free to add your own, instructions are on that page!

 -  This year we are happy to have food trucks over lunch, and BBQ
    grills on both evenings. Fridges will be available where you can
    keep your food for the grill, because most stores will be closed
    on Sunday.

 -  The #accomodation channel on Discord is the place you can
    coordinate with other attendees to find an accommodation
    together.

 -  In case you want to only attend virtually that's absolutely fine
    too! Just show up online and you'll find plenty of people to chat
    and collaborate on projects with.

 -  We will have a beginners track; if you want to join please read
    https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2022/#tracks-beginner and give a thumbs up
    in the #beginners-track channel on discord so we know how many
    people to expect.

 -  Well-Typed will host an advanced track again!  More info can be
    found in their announcement:
    https://well-typed.com/blog/2022/06/well-typed-advanced-track-zurihac-2022/

 -  Switzerland has almost no Corona more measures in place, so you
    won't need to wear a mask or even present vaccination/test
    certificates. It's great, but please only come if you feel
    completely comfortable with that.

 -  Check out https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2022/#getting-there for
    information on how to take the train to the event

 -  ZuriHac is a non-commercial event put together entirely by
    volunteers in their free time!  We may need some extra hands this
    year for relatively light non-technical work (moving benches and
    tables, assisting with the bbqs, ...). Please put a thumbs-up on
    the message in the #volunteers channel if you would be willing to
    donate just a bit of your time to making this event possible :-)

Organising ZuriHac would not be possible without the support of our
sponsors.  Huge thanks for their help -- please check them out, some
of them are hiring!
